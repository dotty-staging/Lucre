   * 1 | 0 |  2

   * Therefore the horizontal orientation can be extracted
   * with `_ & 3`, and the vertical orientation with `_ >> 2`,
   * where orientation is 0 for 'parallel', 1 for 'before' and
   * '3' for 'after', so that if the orient is before or
   * after, the sign can be retrieved via `_ - 2`
   *
   * For example, if this is `LongPoint2D(4, 4)` and the query
   * point is `LongPoint2D(4, 5)`, the result is `12`. If the
   * query is `LongPoint2D(0, 0)`, the result is `5`, etc.
