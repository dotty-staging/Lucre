    * Therefore the horizontal orientation can be extracted
    * with `_ & 3`, and the vertical orientation with `_ >> 2`,
    * where orientation is 0 for 'parallel', 1 for 'before' and
    * '3' for 'after', so that if the orient is before or
    * after, the sign can be retrieved via `_ - 2`
    *
    * For example, if this is `LongPoint2D(4, 4)` and the query
    * point is `LongPoint2D(4, 5)`, the result is `12`. If the
    * query is `LongPoint2D(0, 0)`, the result is `5`, etc.
