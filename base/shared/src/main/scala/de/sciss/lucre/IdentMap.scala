/** An identifier map is basically a transactional map whose keys are system identifiers.
 * However, there are two important aspects: First, the map is always ephemeral
 * (but might be still durable!), even for a confluently persistent system. Second,
 * for systems whose identifiers constitute temporal traces (confluently persistent
 * system), lookup (via `get`, `contains` etc.) finds _any_ value stored for the
 * current version or any older version. That is to say, in a confluently persistent
 * system, it looks up the most recent entry for the key. It is therefore a useful
 * tool to map system entities to ephemeral live views.
 *
 * @tparam T    the underlying system's transaction type
 * @tparam A    the values stored at the keys. `Unit` can be used if only set
 *              functionality is needed.
