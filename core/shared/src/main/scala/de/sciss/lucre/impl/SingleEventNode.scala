/** Standalone events unite a node and one particular event.
 *
 * WARNING: the implementations of `equals` are really tricky right now. `EventImpl` is more specific in that
 * `VirtualNodeSelector` checks if the compared object is another `VirtualNodeSelector` whose reactor has the
 * same id and whose slot is the same. On the other hand `Invariant` inherits `equals` from `Reactor`
 * which checks for another reactor and then compares their ids.
 *
 * I don't know if `Reactor` still needs the `equals` implementation?
